* Zither notes.
** Instrument description
   The tuning/preset data that I've accumulated is pretty daunting in volume.
   I keep wanting to try a John Fahey tablature in an open-D tuning, but digging
   through the data to find it is 
*** 12 string guitar and mandolin should group the doubled strings under a single button
*** zither needs to group the strings into fretted, accompaniment, bass, and contrabass
*** lyre is not fretted, nor are other harps
*** autoharp is not fretted, but it has muting
*** 5 string banjo fifth string frets start at the fifth fret of the main strings.
*** Split voices, run different synths on melody and bass.
	run different voices on each string, or segments of strings
*** Retune the nut differently for melody and bass.
*** Split the fretboard, let the left hand finger the bass while
    the right hand fingers the melody.
** Device control
   So the fretboard is the playing surface, but how do we configure the device.
*** One way to switch to control mode on a phone is to turn it upside down so
    you can look at it.  But phones and tablets simply rotate the display and
    pretend nothing happened.  Maybe if we access the accelerometer directly.
** Implementation problems
*** with the low precision touch on the Pi Foundation display, I get crackling
    when two fingers get to just the right distance.  G on first string B on
    next string does it pretty regularly.
*** Also close fingers merge, which means you can do two finger vibrato by tapping
    a second finger next to a finger already sounding.
*** The earphone cable gets tangled with everything else hanging down.
** Mounting a phone or tablet
*** Hanging around the neck doesn't work.  Aside from the strangling 
   possibilities, it's a tight fit when the screen hangs high enough.
*** Graumont (Encycl. of Knots and Fancy Ropework) has designs for knotted
    cigarette cases which could easily adapt to a hanging cell phone case.
*** But they have no window to expose the screen, the secure mount will have
    a TPU phone case firmly attached to the baldric.
*** The chapman straps pin one pivot at belt ieight with the belt hook,
   then adjusts the angle with the shoulder strap.
   Distance from shoulder to belt is 20-24 inches.
*** Found two stickists with modified guitar straps for hanging their
   sticks from a single shoulder strap.  The belt clip goes over a
   strap hung between the two ends of the shoulder straps.  The upper
   attachment is attached to a secondary strap coming from the shoulder
   strap.
*** Warr guitars just use a guitar strap, perhaps the weight of the body
    helps to balance them,
*** Several users construct floor stands which hold the stick at the right
    height and angle for play.
*** The chapman stick mount is a very nice way to mount a phone, 
   or two phones, or a narrow touch screen, on an actual stick to place the
   tapping screen chest high where both hands can reach comfortably.
*** So we put a baldric over the right or left shoulder
    and attach a phone case or tablet case to the baldric, delegating the
    responsibility for gripping the phone to the phone case, then attaching
    the case to the baldric with MOLLE or velcro.
*** Baldric only needs width over shoulder and where phone is mounted
**** Trust friction to keep it from sliding around the body?
**** Add a weighted payload to the low point to stabilize the baldric.
*** Bling cell phone mounts
** Fretboard layout
** Fretboard decoration
*** The existing, which labels each note chromatically,
    emphasizes the tonic of the scale, and deemphasizes
    the accidentals of the scale.
*** allow the key to be specified for note-to-name 
    so it knows to switch between # and b enharmonics.
*** Piano, scale in white, accidentals in black.
*** Dulcimer, fretted diatonically, accidentals can't be played.
** Data organization
** Playing dynamics
*** customize behavior when one string is touched at more than one point
    currently playing all of them, but could suppress the upstream touches
** Programming details - Tcl/Tk/Linux/Raspberry Pi
*** Touch appears to produce data on /dev/input/event8
  That's on the rpi4 with pi foundation touchscreen
  But only if you don't plug in a usb input device
*** The touch pad on my laptop doesn't seem to produce
  any touch events, but I may need to recheck that.
  No the touch pad produces a lot of touch events, but
  none of them are registered to the screen or window
*** Use lsinput from input-utils to identify the 
  files in /dev/input/*

*** Musix Pro already does this, for Mac users.
	That is, they provide a variety of isomorphic keyboards
	in a variety of presentations and let you noodle about.
*** Oh, the Chapman Stick is a six string bass, tuned in fifths, from
 high down to low, and a six string guitar, tuned in fourths, from
 low to high, so 12 strings, or 10 strings by dropping a pair of
 strings, or you could do a 10 string with 4 bass and 6 melody
 strings.
**** Looking at stickman.com videos, one holds the stick like a cello
   with a cross brace resting on his lap, the head of the stick over
   his left shoulder.
** Hardware
*** There is a 8.8 inch touchscreen, 1360x480 pixels, hdmi + usb
  for $75 at amazon, suddenly makes a lot of sense.
  Don't believe that screen is really 10 point touch, as all the
  look alike screens specify 5 point touch.
*** Found an 8 inch 10 point touch screen on AliExpress for $30.
  A little thin on the description  (resolution? interface?)
  but it will probably do, and $30 isn't much to venture.  I suspect
  it's a DSI interface for the screen and obviously USB for touch and
  power. 
*** This 8 inch screen is approximately an iPad Mini size and I think
  that will be a favored size, but we'll see.  The plan is to make
  a board mount for it, and for this RPi 7.7 inch display, too.
** Chapman stick dimensions
   Note that most of the length is to accomodate the string length
   required to get the desired tuning, and the scale length is there
   to accomodate the fret lengths required to get the desired range.
   Scale length is 2 * (distance from nut to the octave fret)

*** The take away from those specifications are that
**** A phone based instrument at 8 or 10 strings is well within the stick envelope on string spacing
**** An even tighter spacing might work, because the capacitive sensing is winner take all, suppressing 
   the neighboring positions.
** The overall strategy for making money on the project
*** Give away the software.
*** Sell the rig to mount the user's phone or tablet to play.
**** Doesn't need the tensile bracing that the stick or guitars require.
**** Doesn't need the length to stretch strings.
**** Does need position cues for hands, since the screen has neither strings nor frets.
**** Does need RF screening for the body side of the phoned
*** Sell accessories that 
*** The strategy with respect to knock-offs is to give them too many opportunities
   to copy, leave them dazzled with too many possibilities to function effectively.
*** The case should provide a dock
*** for power in, via battery or external charger
*** for audio out to a stereo jack
*** and HID in to control, a rotary encoder with push switch should do.
*** for audio in when we enable the breath control and mouthpieces
*** for usb hid providing air pressure 
** Scale length is roughly the distance from nut to bridge
   (The roughness comes from details of bridge placement, which depends on the
   mechanical details of the bridge)
*** scale length of a guitarish instrument is 2 * (length from nut to octave fret).
*** so 1/2 scale length is the distance from nut to first octave fret.
*** and 3/4 scale length is the distance from nut to second octave fret.
*** and 7/8 scale length is the distance from nute to third octave fret, but no
    guitar has a third octave fret.

*** Luthier web site (stemac.com) gave me this table for 24 frets on a 24" scale
  length.  I'm guessing that if I computed the wavelength for the freqencies
  of the chromatic scale, using the midi-to-frequency formula, that the unfretted
  string lengths would be proportional to the wavelengths.
