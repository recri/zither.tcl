* Touch appears to produce data on /dev/input/event8
  That's on the rpi4 with pi foundation touchscreen
  But only if you don't plug in a usb input device
* The touch pad on my laptop doesn't seem to produce
  any touch events, but I may need to recheck that.
* Use lsinput from input-utils to identify the 
  files in /dev/input/*
