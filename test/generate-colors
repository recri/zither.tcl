package require cantk::oklab

##
## use oklab to select 11 colors to represent the notes of the chromatic scale
## so colorings of the notes included in the scales of diffent modes in different
## keys share a relative color pattern.
##

##
## oklab or oklch, I have no way of choosing a color in oklab, but I can take
## an srgb and map it in.  Toss in a ring of points and set them to maximise
## their distance matrix, subject to remaining a color in srgb gamut.
