* Zither, instruments with many strings on multitouch screens.
** Some number of strings stretching the long way across the screen.
*** The number of strings may be specified
*** The tuning of the strings may be specified
** Some number of frets across the short dimension of the screen
*** Unfretted, as in violin, viola, cello, etc.
*** Chromatically fretted, as in guitar, banjo, mandolin, etc.
*** Diatonically fretted, as in dulcimer, etc.
** The fretboard generates notes when the musician taps.
*** The position of the tap maps to a position on a string which 
    specifies the frequency of the note sounded.
*** Notes may be quantized to the nearest fret or allowed to take on
    intermediate tones.
*** Sliding the finger along the string direction slides the note to
    the new position or fret.
*** Sliding the finger across the string direction after the initial tap     
    bends the note
*** Multiple simultaneous taps on the same string may sound together,
    or the furthest down string tap may take precedence.
*** The technical details of capacitive touch mean that close touches
    may not be resolved into separate fingers, but may merge into one
    super finger.  This will depend on the hardware.
** The notes may be realized 
*** by using a synthesized instrument 
**** The available synths are free physical instrument models from the
   Faust distribution.  See https://faust.grame.fr
*** or by generating MIDI events
*** or by generating OSC events
** The fretboard is mounted at chest height facing out so that the 
   left and right hands can tap from opposite sides of the "neck".
** The fretboard may be split into different sections.   
   For instance, the upper half of the fretboard may be tuned to the
   6 bass strings of a 12-string Chapman Stick for the left hand, while 
   the lower half is tuned to the 6 melody strings for the right hand.
** At least one string x fret position is allocated to trigger the
   configuration dialog.
** Other string x fret positions may be allocated to trigger other
   functions, such as key modulation, string retuning, etc.
* Extensions
** Implement a breath controller with a barometer and a tube.
	USB MIDI device.
** Implement a microphone with a tube and a mems microphone.
	USB Audio device, possibly combined with the USB Audio
	output.
** Implement pressure velocity sensitivity with some overlay
	on the touch screen.  Or an underlay.
** Implement tactile and/or visual position cues.
*** An overlay with monofilament line marking strings and frets
	would need to be changed if the number of strings or frets
	changed.
*** fret markers
* Inspirations
** GeoShred Pro
** Musix Pro
** Chapman Stick
