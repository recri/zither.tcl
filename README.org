* Oh, Musix Pro already does this, for Mac users.
* Oh, the Chapman Stick is a six string bass, tuned in fifths, from
 high down to low, and a six string guitar, tuned in fourtsh, from
 low to high, so 12 strings, or 10 strings by dropping a pair of
 strings, or you could do a 10 string with 4 bass and 6 melody
 strings.
** Looking at stickman.com videos, one holds the stick like a cello
   with a cross brace resting on his lap, the head of the stick over
   his left shoulder.
*** That would be a very nice way to mount a phone, or two phones, or
   a narrow touch screen, on an actual stick to place the tapping screen
   at nipple height where both hands can reach comfortably.
* There is a 8.8 inch touchscreen, 1360x480 pixels, hdmi + usb
  for $75 at amazon, suddenly makes a lot of sense.
  Don't believe that screen is really 10 point touch, as all the
  look alike screens specify 5 point touch.
* Found an 8 inch 10 point touch screen on AliExpress for $30.
  A little thin on the description  (resolution? interface?)
  but it will probably do, and $30 isn't much to venture.
* This 8 inch screen is approximately an iPad Mini size and I think
  that will be a favored size, but we'll see.  The plan is to make
  a board mount for it, and for this RPi 7.7 inch display, too.
